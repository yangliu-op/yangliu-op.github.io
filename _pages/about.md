I am currently a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at **Great Bay University**, based at the [Intelligent Computing Research Center](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/menu/208) of the Great Bay Institute for Advanced Study, with a joint appointment in the [School of Computing and Information Technology](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/menu/177).

Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Coralia Cartis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/coralia.cartis). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Prof. Fred Roosta](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/FredRoosta/).
