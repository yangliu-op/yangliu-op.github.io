I am currently a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at **Great Bay University**(GBU), based at the [Center for Intelligent Computing](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/menu/208) of the Great Bay Institute for Advanced Study, with a joint appointment in the [School of Computing and Information Technology](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/menu/177) at GBU.  

Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Coralia Cartis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/coralia.cartis). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Prof. Fred Roosta](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/FredRoosta/).

Research interests
----
My research lies at the intersection of **numerical optimization** and **numerical linear algebra**, with an emphasis on scalability under limited memory and compute, and connections to **high-performance computing** and **AI for Mathematics**. Current focuses include:
- **Second- and higher-order methods** for large-scale **nonconvex** optimization (complexity, design, and analysis)
- **Iterative methods and solvers** for linear and nonlinear systems (including preconditioning)
- Extensions to **stochastic, randomized, and distributed** settings, and **high-performance implementations**
- Foundations and early applications of **formal methods** (e.g., proof assistants / checkable reasoning) for reliable optimization and training workflows
